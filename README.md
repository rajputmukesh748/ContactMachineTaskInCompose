#Android App Documentation


<h3>Introduction</h3>
Provide a brief overview of the app, its purpose, and its key features.


<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
List the technologies you have used to develop the app. Include the following:

1. Jetpack Compose: Explain how you have used Jetpack Compose for creating the UI and its advantages over traditional Android UI development.
2. Clean Architecture with Repository Design Pattern: Describe how you have implemented the clean architecture principles in your app and the benefits it offers.
3. Retrofit and OkHttp: Explain how you have used Retrofit and OkHttp libraries for making API calls and integrating them with the repository design pattern.
4. Room: Describe how you have used Room for storing data such as contacts or messages and provide details on the database structure.
5. Navigation: Explain how you have used the Navigation component for handling fragment navigation within your app.
6. Dagger Hilt: Describe how you have used Dagger Hilt for dependency injection and provide examples of how it simplifies the app's architecture.
7. Coroutines: Explain how you have used Coroutines for managing asynchronous operations and handling concurrency in your app.
8. Kotlin Gradle (.kts): Describe how you have used Kotlin Gradle scripts for build configuration and provide any specific details relevant to your app.
9. Version Catalog (.toml): Explain how you have utilized the Version Catalog feature and its benefits for managing dependencies and versions in your app.
10. Vonage: Describe how you have integrated Vonage for sending SMS and explain any relevant details related to the integration.


<h3>App Architecture</h3>
Explain the architecture of your app, providing an overview of each layer and its responsibilities. Include the following:

1. AppController: Describe the purpose of the AppController class and how it initializes the HILT dependency injection framework.
2. UseCases: Explain the role of UseCases in your app and how they handle API calls or data fetching from the database.
3. ViewModels: Describe how ViewModels interact with the UseCases to fetch data and manage UI states.
4. Views: Explain how you have implemented the UI using Jetpack Compose and provide examples or guidelines for handling UI-related tasks.
5. Presentation Layer: Describe how the Presentation Layer handles UI states and communicates with the ViewModels.
6. Data Layer: Explain the responsibilities of the Data Layer, including managing data classes (DTOs) and implementing repository interfaces.
7. Domain Layer: Describe the role of the Domain Layer in your app, including the definition of repository interfaces and implementation of use cases.
8. DI: Explain how the DI (Dependency Injection) module initializes all the necessary modules and provides singleton instances, including the database and Retrofit.
9. DB: Describe how the DB package initializes the DAOs and the abstract classes for the database.
10. Vonage: Explain any specific implementation details related to the integration of Vonage with Retrofit for sending SMS.


<h3>Benefits</h3>
Highlight the benefits and advantages of the technologies and architecture choices you have made. Include the following:

1. Clean Architecture: Explain how using Clean Architecture separates network and business logic, leading to easier maintainability and testability.
2. Room: Describe how using Room for data storage simplifies data management and provides offline capabilities.
3. JSON Data: Explain how you read JSON files and store the contacts in the database, emphasizing any performance optimizations or background thread handling.
4. Retrofit: Describe how Retrofit and the repository design pattern simplify API integration and data retrieval.
5. Jetpack Compose: Explain the advantages of using Jetpack Compose for creating a declarative UI and any specific features you have utilized in your app.


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Wrap up the documentation by summarizing the key points and mentioning any additional information or resources that may be helpful for developers working with your app.

Remember to provide clear and concise explanations, include relevant code snippets or diagrams where necessary, and make the documentation easily readable for other developers.
