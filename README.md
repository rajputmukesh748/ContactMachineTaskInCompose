#Android App Documentation

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Provide a brief overview of the app, its purpose, and its key features.


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
List the technologies you have used to develop the app. Include the following:

1. Jetpack Compose: Explain how you have used Jetpack Compose for creating the UI and its advantages over traditional Android UI development.
2. Clean Architecture with Repository Design Pattern: Describe how you have implemented the clean architecture principles in your app and the benefits it offers.
3. Retrofit and OkHttp: Explain how you have used Retrofit and OkHttp libraries for making API calls and integrating them with the repository design pattern.
4. Room: Describe how you have used Room for storing data such as contacts or messages and provide details on the database structure.
5. Navigation: Explain how you have used the Navigation component for handling fragment navigation within your app.
6. Dagger Hilt: Describe how you have used Dagger Hilt for dependency injection and provide examples of how it simplifies the app's architecture.
7. Coroutines: Explain how you have used Coroutines for managing asynchronous operations and handling concurrency in your app.
8. Kotlin Gradle (.kts): Describe how you have used Kotlin Gradle scripts for build configuration and provide any specific details relevant to your app.
9. Version Catalog (.toml): Explain how you have utilized the Version Catalog feature and its benefits for managing dependencies and versions in your app.
10. Vonage: Describe how you have integrated Vonage for sending SMS and explain any relevant details related to the integration.


<h2>App Architecture</h2>
Explain the architecture of your app, providing an overview of each layer and its responsibilities. Include the following:

1. AppController: Describe the purpose of the AppController class and how it initializes the HILT dependency injection framework.
2. UseCases: Explain the role of UseCases in your app and how they handle API calls or data fetching from the database.
3. ViewModels: Describe how ViewModels interact with the UseCases to fetch data and manage UI states.
4. Views: Explain how you have implemented the UI using Jetpack Compose and provide examples or guidelines for handling UI-related tasks.
5. Presentation Layer: Describe how the Presentation Layer handles UI states and communicates with the ViewModels.
6. Data Layer: Explain the responsibilities of the Data Layer, including managing data classes (DTOs) and implementing repository interfaces.
7. Domain Layer: Describe the role of the Domain Layer in your app, including the definition of repository interfaces and implementation of use cases.
8. DI: Explain how the DI (Dependency Injection) module initializes all the necessary modules and provides singleton instances, including the database and Retrofit.
9. DB: Describe how the DB package initializes the DAOs and the abstract classes for the database.
10. Vonage: Explain any specific implementation details related to the integration of Vonage with Retrofit for sending SMS.


<h2>Benefits</h2>
Highlight the benefits and advantages of the technologies and architecture choices you have made. Include the following:

1. Clean Architecture: Explain how using Clean Architecture separates network and business logic, leading to easier maintainability and testability.
2. Room: Describe how using Room for data storage simplifies data management and provides offline capabilities.
3. JSON Data: Explain how you read JSON files and store the contacts in the database, emphasizing any performance optimizations or background thread handling.
4. Retrofit: Describe how Retrofit and the repository design pattern simplify API integration and data retrieval.
5. Jetpack Compose: Explain the advantages of using Jetpack Compose for creating a declarative UI and any specific features you have utilized in your app.
